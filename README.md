# Frazzled
Code from the You Tube Model Railway Electronics Series

Arduino Files related to the model railway series, will try to keep them updated

Episode 4:         Controlling the LEDs with an interlock option

Episode 5:         The working code as edited during the video - servo motor moving in response to button presses

Episode 5 slow:    code moving the servo slowly

Episode 5 fast:    code moving the servo quickly

Episode 6:         driving a relay

Episode 7:         read an analogue sensor and add a second interlock function

Episode 8:         Adding a liquid crystal display screen

Episode 9:        PCF8574 8 bit port expander using the I2C bus - Mooooorrrrr pins!

Episode 10:        No code for this episode

Episode 11:        Rotary Encoder!

Episode 12:        SK6812RGBW LED example for building lighting

speed_test:        Code to run the speed profiling, assumes a linux system, edit "cred.h" with MQTT details

LeopardStreetBoardD_V2    Code used to run one of the Leopard Street Board Controllers, shows interfacing to MQTT and a PCF8575. presented as an example only, this uses custom libraries that will be presented later for servo control
